                            Hey, I‚Äôm Ariel. I live in Melbourne, FL and I‚Äôm a
                            Software Engineer at Lockheed Martin, an aerospace,
                            arms, defense, information security, and technology
                            company with worldwide interests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have a background and over 3 years experience as a
                            Customer Service and Technical Support
                            Representative. Some of the companies I worked for
                            are Amazon.com, Hewlett-Packard and
                            CareerBuilder.com
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After deciding that I wanted to shift away from call
                            centers, I joined the United States Army as a Tank
                            Crewman, primarily stationed in Fort Bliss, Texas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After honorably serving the U.S. Army, I
                            successfully obtained a Bachelor of Science Degree
                            in Computer Science from the University of Florida.
